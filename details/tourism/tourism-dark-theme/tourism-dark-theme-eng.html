				<div class="-dark-att1-text-block">
					
					<p>Renowned as one of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" id="-dark-att1-text-block-link1" href="https://www.creativebloq.com/architecture/famous-buildings-around-world-10121105">most beautiful buildings in the world</a>, the spellbinding Byzantine glory of the Aya Sofya Museum (Hagia Sophia) is not only one of the top things to do in Istanbul, but also in Turkey. The staggering bulk of its exterior is rimmed by the delicate minarets added after the Ottoman conquest, while the sumptuous and cavernous frescoed interior is a grand reminder of old Constantinople's might and power. This famed monument is a must-do for every tourist visiting the country.</p>

				<h1>2 - Ephesus</h1>
				<img src="../../../pics/tourism/ephesus.jpg">

				 <div class="-dark-att2-text-block">
					
					<p>Not to be missed, the mighty ruin of Ephesus is a city of colossal monuments and marble-columned roads. One of the most complete, still-standing Roman cities in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mediterranean_countries">Mediterranean region</a>, this is the place to experience what life must have been like during the golden age of the Roman Empire. A sightseeing trip here will take at least half a day to cover the major highlights and longer, if you really want to explore, so make sure that you plan your visit so you don't feel rushed.</p>

				<h1>3 - Cappadocia</h1>
				<img src="../../../pics/tourism/cappadocia.jpg">

				 <div class="-dark-att3-text-block">
					
					<p>The surreal swooping rock valleys of Cappadocia are every photographer's dream. Cliff ridges and hill crests are home to rippling panoramas of wave-like rock or wacky-shaped pinnacles that have been formed by millennia of wind and water action. And if you don't feel like hiking for the views, this is one of the world's top destinations to take a hot air balloon ride. If the lunarscape isn't enough to tempt you, nestled in these valleys are the frescoed rock-cut churches of the Byzantine Era, when this area was an important early Christian site.</p>

				<h1>4 - Topkapı Palace</h1>
				<img src="../../../pics/tourism/topkapi.jpg">

				 <div class="-dark-att4-text-block">
					
					<p>Sumptuous beyond belief, the Topkapı Palace takes you into the fantastical, opulent world of the sultans. It was from here that the sultans of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.history.com/topics/middle-east/ottoman-empire"> Ottoman Era</a> carved out an empire that would extend up into Europe and down through the Middle East and into Africa. The interiors, with their decadently exuberant tiling and lavish jeweled decor, are an unforgettable peek into the Ottoman's power base. The surrounding public gardens were once the sole domain of the Royal Court but are now open to the public and provide a tranquil, green respite from the city streets.</p>

				<h1>5 - Pamukkale</h1>
				<img src="../../../pics/tourism/topkapi.jpg">

				 <div class="-dark-att5-text-block">
					
					<p>One of Turkey's most famous natural wonders, the pure white travertine terraces of Pamukkale ("Cotton Castle" in English) cascade down the slope looking like an out-of-place snowfield amid the green landscape. Although the travertines are themselves a highlight of a Turkey trip, the vast and rambling ruins of Roman Hierapolis, an ancient spa town, lie on the top of this calcite hill, providing another reason to visit. For the best photographs, come at dusk when the travertines glow as the sun sinks below the horizon.</p>

				<h1>6 - Sumela Monastery</h1>
				<img src="../../../pics/tourism/sumela.jpg">

				 <div class="-dark-att6-text-block">
					
					<p>With its stunning, lonely setting, built into a cliff face, Sumela Monastery (Monastery of the Virgin Mary) is the star attraction for visitors along the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/blacksea.htm">Black Sea</a> Coast. Wandering around this abandoned religious complex, with its church interiors crammed with dazzling and vibrant frescoes, is a must for anyone who makes the long journey to Turkey's northeast region. The monastery first opened during the Byzantine era and was only closed in 1923. Today, wandering its empty cells, it's easy to imagine the isolated lives of the monks who once lived here.</p>
